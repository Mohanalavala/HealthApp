## Half day 2:

Time allotted 4 hours: Worth 300 points

1) A zoom meeting was held on 08/23/2020 at 10AM to discuss about the design, features and plan of our project. 

2) Based upon their area of interest and skills of everyone, a work was assigned to each team member in Jira. As I am interested in designing, UI sketches was assigned to me.

3) Initially I made the overview of UI sketches with help of my teammate Tejaswi and designed nine screens. As the Launch screen is the most important thing, I kept a lot of time mainly on it. However, UI sketches are one of vital part of any application.

4) I designed the UI sketches by getting the best out of us and committed the UI sketches (proposed screens) as a folder into repository.
