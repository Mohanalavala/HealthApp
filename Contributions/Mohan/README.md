# Module1 Individual 1

Hello, I am Mohan Krishna Alvala. Team Lead of the Group 2 of project Health App, Clients Dr. Badami and Dr. Rhonda Beemer.

We have discussed the requirements in a Zoom session and finalized a few tables. I have created an ER model based on the discussion. Later we made some changes to the ER model. In the ER diagram, I have taken Admin, User, Challenges, and Exercise entities. In each entity, I have added attributes based on requirements.
