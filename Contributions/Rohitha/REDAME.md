## Half day 1
We all together scheduled a zoom meeting on 08/21/2020 at 10AM to discuss about the client requirements. One of our team member created a repository named Health App and included me as contributor. Invited me to accept the link, I have accepted the link and started working on the project.
I have created account in Jira. One of our team member assigned me a task in Jira, I have accepted the task and finished it.
I have gone through the RFP provided by Dr.Badami to get an overview about the requirements and to get an idea about how to design an app.
